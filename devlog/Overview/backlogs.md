fix: types in #file:types is a reflectionf from #file:schemas 

- Seller can have sold view of used to own product instead of removed
-> have a ownership tables, when sold, have a snapshot at sold time, if item is still public, show both view (snapshot and current) 

- Listed item must be public 
-> Item visibility > Wardrobe visiblity



# backlogs 


- (dont implement or think much of this as it's a overcomplication): seller can create a listing of multiple copies of same product 
After bought by a buyer, he owns that piece of product with a quantity ???

- client-side image removal or server side  ? client side for now, xoa nen hoi lau nhe, va bi nhoe
