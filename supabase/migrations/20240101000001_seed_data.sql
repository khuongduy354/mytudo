-- Migration: 002_seed_data
-- Description: Seed data for development and testing
-- Note: Auth users are seeded via supabase/seed.ts using Admin API
-- This avoids bcrypt hash/salt issues with SQL seeding

-- Application data seeding is also handled by seed.ts
-- This file is kept for migration history but actual seeding happens via TypeScript
